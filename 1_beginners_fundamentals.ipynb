    "## Python variables are Pointers\n",
    "In many programming languages, variables are best thought of as containers or buckets into which you put data. \n",
    "So in C, for example, when you write the following you are essentially defining a \"memory bucket\" named x, and putting the value 4 into it. \n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "// C code\n",
    "int x = 4;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, by contrast, variables are best thought of not as containers but as pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "you are essentially defining a *pointer* named ``x`` that points to some other bucket containing the value ``4``.\n",
    "Note one consequence of this: because Python variables just point to various objects, there is no need to \"declare\" the variable, or even require the variable to always point to information of the same type!\n",
    "This is the sense in which people say Python is *dynamically-typed*: variable names can point to objects of any type.\n",
